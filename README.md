# RL-course-project
Course project for Reinforcement Learning  
Based on a custom env of Open AI Gym, the goal is to train the agent to solve a maze (from 10 by 10 to 100 by 100).  
`maze_2d_q_learning.py` Algorithm for traditional Q learning  
`maze_2d_deep_q_learning_cnn.py` Algorithm for DQN, with CNN (built with PyTorch)
